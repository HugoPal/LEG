# LEG: Predicting end of larval period for grayling

LEG tool is a modelling approach for lab-raised European Grayling _Thymallus thymallus_ to predict when an individual will end the larval period and it's length at that point. The repository contains the LEGtool, a data folder that your data will go in, and a models folder containing the three models the tool uses.

Details of the tool are available in Palejowski et al. _in prep_

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Include the following:
 - R version
 - Packages, their versions

The LEGtool was developed using R version 4.0.2.
It uses 

### Usage

- Briefly explain how to use the tool: "run script X using your R environment or whatever"
- State that the data should follow a specified format (let the user know that you describe this format in more detail in `data/` and let them know how to retrieve your data and where to place it). This could be a small subsection as well tbh
- Describe the outputs, you can follow a similar schema as [here](https://github.com/marikomakhm/vpm-classifier#prediction) to describe what is generated when running your script

## Structure

_Table describing the contents of this repo (e.g. models/ contains models, etc.). Not obligatory, sometimes adds clarity. I usually do this but it's up to you_

## Citing

_Describe how to cite your work, typically this is something you can update once your paper is complete and in a journal. You can replace this with a "todo" or reference your preprint in the meantime. Or just state the authors, idk_
