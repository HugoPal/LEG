# LEG: Predicting end of larval period for grayling

_3-4 line summary describing the repo contents_

### Abstract

_insert abstract here, if you wish. otherwise replace previous description with a longer one_

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Include the following:
 - R version
 - Packages, their versions

### Usage

- Briefly explain how to use the tool: "run script X using your R environment or whatever"
- State that the data should follow a specified format (let the user know that you describe this format in more detail in `data/` and let them know how to retrieve your data and where to place it). This could be a small subsection as well tbh
- Describe the outputs, you can follow a similar schema as [here](https://github.com/marikomakhm/vpm-classifier#prediction) to describe what is generated when running your script

## Structure

_Table describing the contents of this repo (e.g. models/ contains models, etc.). Not obligatory, sometimes adds clarity. I usually do this but it's up to you_

## Citing

_Describe how to cite your work, typically this is something you can update once your paper is complete and in a journal. You can replace this with a "todo" or reference your preprint in the meantime. Or just state the authors, idk_
